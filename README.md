# Arduino-library-I2CtunnelW

New REST commands, enabling tunnelling for I2C messages:

-  /arduino/I2C/<device>/B|W/<address>/<count>/           -> I2C read data (dataHEX)
-  /arduino/I2C/<device>/B|W/<address>/<count>/<dataHEX>  -> I2C write data

This small footprint library allows to execute some tasks on linux side (using python, php, javascript ...) and not inside the arduino sketch. This can be a great help, because the Arduino YÃ¹n sketch space is limited to  28.672 byte. 
In examples you can see how to set the linux clock from RTC, or how to adjust the RTC clock from a WEB page, or how put and get a string in EEPROM.

note: tested using Arduino YUN and DS1307, AT24C32 - The code is optimized for smallest footprint.
